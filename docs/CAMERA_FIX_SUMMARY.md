# Camera Display Fix Summary

## Problem
The camera was stretching faces because it was using an incorrect aspect ratio. The user reported:
- Camera was too wide, stretching faces completely
- AI widget at the top was taking up too much space
- Corner markers were positioned incorrectly

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Camera Aspect Ratio
- Changed from 3:4 (0.75) to 4:3 (1.33) aspect ratio for portrait orientation
- This is the standard aspect ratio for selfie cameras
- Updated camera preview to use AspectRatio widget with the camera controller's native aspect ratio
- Fixed both the camera preview and the loading placeholder to use the same dimensions

### 2. Made Welcome Widget Smaller
- Reduced padding from 20x12 to 16x8
- Removed subtitle "Professional-grade analysis"
- Changed icon size from 24 to 20
- Changed text style from labelLarge to labelMedium
- Added mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min to make it compact
- Centered the widget on the page

### 3. Updated Face Overlay
- Adjusted oval dimensions for portrait camera (65% width, 45% height)
- Reduced corner marker size from 30 to 25 pixels
- Fixed corner marker positioning to align properly with the oval
- Made the tips section more compact with smaller margins

### 4. Updated Selected Image Height
- Changed from fixed 300px to dynamic height based on 4:3 aspect ratio
- Ensures consistency across all image display modes

## Technical Details

### Camera Preview Changes
```dart
// Before (incorrect - too wide)
const double aspectRatio = 3.0 / 4.0; // 0.75

// After (correct - portrait selfie)
const double aspectRatio = 4.0 / 3.0; // 1.33
```

### Camera Widget Implementation
```dart
// Now uses AspectRatio widget with camera's native aspect ratio
Center(
  child: AspectRatio(
    aspectRatio: _cameraController!.value.aspectRatio,
    child: CameraPreview(_cameraController!),
  ),
)
```

## Result
- Camera now displays faces without stretching
- Proper portrait orientation for selfie camera
- More screen space for camera preview
- Better user experience for taking skin analysis photos
